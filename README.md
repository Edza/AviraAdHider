#How to works? How do I know this is not a virus?
- This tool doesnt even need administrator priviliges
- Avira shows ads by simply starting a program called ipmgui. This tool wait for it to start and then kills it
- Original source code is 20 lines, just go look at it there is nothing there

This works as of Q1 of 2016. If it stops working create a new issue, I'll fix it.
